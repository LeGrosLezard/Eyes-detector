# Eyes-detector in progress

  Hello my name's Jb i've 25 years old, young graduate of OpenClassrooms on web developpement, computer enthusiast I tried to make an eyes tracking.

Here we detect if the person gets up, bends down, backs up, looks up, down, right, left, also top right, top left, bottom ... if the person gets up or down we recalculate then the position; focus on the code. In order to do this we must take into account the position of the eyes on the x and y axis.



--v2--- In progress

At first we need to do an initialization who will calculate the position of the eyes

# Concretely what is that for ? 

Did you know PNL ? it's a theory on the visual fields and the gaze...

# Limit

course this is a limit in case the personn is too agitated, all depend on a face detection. There are so many false detections. We need to put out the hair. We cannot make for example the personn look up on the left.
