# Eyes-detector in progress

  Hello my name's Jb i've 25 years old, young graduate of OpenClassrooms on web developpement, computer enthusiast I tried to make an eyes tracking.

Here we detect if the person gets up, bends down, backs up, looks up, down, right, left, also top right, top left, bottom ... if the person gets up or down we recalculate then the position; focus on the code. In order to do this we must take into account the position of the eyes on the x and y axis.




---V1--

At first we need to do an initialization who will calculate the position of the eyes
