# Eyes-detector in progress

  Hello my name's Jb i've 25 years old, young graduate of OpenClassrooms on web developpement, computer enthusiast I tried to make an eyes tracking.

Here we detect if the person gets up, bends down, backs up, looks up, down, right, left, also top right, top left, bottom ... if the person gets up or down we recalculate then the position; focus on the code. In order to do this we must take into account the position of the eyes on the x and y axis.



# --version 2--- In progress

# Concretely what is that for ? 

But that can serve more than anything else! Mr Hawkins, one of the most brilliant physicists of our century and Physic, needed it to be able to communicate. We were able to find out how a user could look at a web page for example and what information to put on such a site.

Did you know PNL ? it's a theory on the visual fields and the gaze associate to our things

For our personal project, use this to be able to say what a user thinks in conversation through this process

From my 17 years old i try and try to match Patrick Jane or Spencer Ried. SPOILER, beginner pay attention to what is said, may be strange.

Tt depends a lot on the threshold, the hair is a source of false detection, it depends on the detection of the eyes during initialization.

# ---Version 1--

At first we need to do an initialization who will calculate the position of the eyes

# Library

 Python 3.x
 
 pip
 
 python-opencv



# Architecture

A main.py file (where we lunch the program) who depends of image_processing.py. 

image_processing.py who dependance of haarcascade form the haar folder

# Limit

course this is a limit in case the personn is too agitated, all depend on a face detection. 

There are so many false detections. We need to put out the hair.

We cannot make for example the personn look up on the left.
